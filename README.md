# Widget

I will be building a Widget application that will include multiple components. These components will be:

- An Accordion component

- A Wikipedia API search component

- A Dropdown item selection component

- A Google Translate API component

I will then wrap up the Widget application by building my own navigation using JS and React without a third-party library like React Router. This will be used to navigate between the different widget components that were built.

Still more work to be done and need to finish off some styling. Most functionality is up and running.

###### Took some time on other projects. Starting back up again
